## Summary
A highly accomplished AI/ML Solutions Architect with 15+ years of experience, specializing in designing, deploying, and optimizing large-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Generative AI systems. Proven track record in leveraging open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral) and cloud-based platforms to deliver innovative solutions in FinTech and Healthcare sectors. Expert in Python, distributed computing (Spark, Dask), and MLOps practices.

## Core Technical Skills
* **LLM Frameworks:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama API
* **Languages:** Python (Expert), Scala, SQL, Bash
* **ML/AI:** RAG, Prompt Engineering, Fine-Tuning (LoRA, QLoRA), Reinforcement Learning (RLHF)
* **Vector Databases:** ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, PgVector
* **Cloud/DevOps:** AWS (S3, SageMaker, EKS), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

## TechNova Solutions - Lead AI/ML Architect (2018 - Present)
* Spearheaded the design and deployment of a secure, internal RAG system using **Mistral 7B** and **ChromaDB** to allow financial analysts to query complex internal regulatory documents, reducing compliance research time by 40%.
* Managed an MLOps team responsible for the continuous integration and deployment of 5+ proprietary LLM models via Kubernetes, ensuring 99.9% uptime.
* Developed a dynamic prompt engineering pipeline for a customer service chatbot, improving first-call resolution rates by 15% through context-aware generation.

# Page 3: Professional Experience - Healthcare
## MediData Labs - Solutions Engineer (2012 - 2018)
* Designed a document ingestion pipeline using **Apache Spark** to process over 10 million electronic health records (EHRs) and convert them into structured knowledge for a later RAG implementation.
* Implemented a medical transcription summarization service using a fine-tuned **Gemma 2B** model, achieving a 92% accuracy rate in generating clinical notes summaries.
* Used **Weaviate** to store vector embeddings of patient data, enabling rapid semantic search across disparate medical documents.

# Page 4: Projects & Publications
## Project: Local RAG Utility CLI (2024)
* Built a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) for running RAG against local markdown and PDF files, exclusively using the **Ollama** Python client and a local **Llama 3 8B** model.
* Open-sourced on GitHub (jt-ai-dev/local-rag-cli). Features included custom chunking strategies and parameter tuning for generation.

## Publication: "The Role of Quantized Models in Edge-RAG Systems" (2023)
* Authored a peer-reviewed paper examining the performance trade-offs of using 4-bit and 8-bit quantized LLMs (like QLoRA Llama) in RAG applications on resource-constrained devices.
